Use FC command to compare files 

Its good to have all version to compare and roll back to.

Commits are new versions of code. Snapshot of every file in repository at time of commit.

Good to be able to commit versions when it makes logical sense but has user error.

can save multiple files in one commit

git log to track commits

git diff to see changes in a commit and the next or last commit.

git clone and html to clone repository and all commits.

can use git checkout and version number to revert to an older version of the code.

git init initialises a new repo with 0 commits

git status to say whats going on
